Camera Frame Publisher
======================

This module provides a clean, simple way to read frames from RTSP cameras
and make them available to other processes via shared memory.

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. When a camera is added, CameraPublisher starts automatically
2. It connects to the RTSP stream and decodes frames at the camera's native FPS
3. Each frame is converted to BGR format and stored in shared memory
4. Other processes (agents, live stream) can read the latest frame anytime
5. Only the latest frame is kept (no buffering) for low latency

KEY CONCEPTS:
-------------
- One CameraPublisher per camera (avoids duplicate RTSP connections)
- Runs at camera's native FPS (no artificial limiting)
- Latest-frame-only storage (shared_store[camera_id])
- Independent from agents (agents sample at their own rate)
